# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to use a neural network to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDb dataset. The objective is to classify each review as either **positive** or **negative** based on its textual content.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `5. Neural networks I - Sentiment analysis.ipynb` — A Jupyter notebook that walks through data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- `reviews.txt` — A file containing raw movie review texts.
- `labels.txt` — A file containing sentiment labels ("positive" or "negative") corresponding to each review.

## 🚀 Features

- Loads and preprocesses raw text data.
- Constructs a simple feedforward neural network from scratch or using a deep learning framework.
- Trains the model to recognize sentiment patterns.
- Evaluates accuracy and visualizes performance metrics.
- Clean and educational step-by-step code.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- pandas
